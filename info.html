                <p>Collectivore was created in response to the idea of waste-free consumption. It is a digital tool that creates a tactile simulation of consumption in the real world (without having to spend any $$$).</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Inspired by Gashapon machines, Collectivore uses a randomization code that produces varying results with every capsule. So everytime you visit this site, your chances are as even as they were in the beginning. </p>
